## Cork and Memory
Cork is an object imbricated with memory: people keep the stoppers from the champagne bottle from their wedding and other memorable events. Yet many are unaware that cork, both the object and cork oak tree it is derived from, has experienced cycles of forgetting as well. Perhaps the most famous story is the supposed rediscovery of cork stoppers by the French Benedictine monk Dom Pierre Pérignon. In the late seventeenth century, he successfully refined a winemaking technique that blended black and red grapes to create a clear sparkling wine at the Hautvillers Abbey in northeastern France (a predecessor of contemporary sparkling wine champagne, inspiring the famous brand named after him). But how to keep the bubbles in the bottle? Pérignon turned to a plant whose bark had been used extensively for centuries—the cork oak tree. According to the most famous version of the story, Pérignon realized that cork could seal his champagne bottles when he observed Spanish travelers using tree bark to seal their water gourds.  The connection of Pérignon and the discovery of cork bottle stoppers appears ineluctable in popular culture, but not only do historians today have evidence that cork was used in Europe prior to Pérignon, it was in fact a rediscovery of a lost art!

In Dom Pérignon’s period, barrels were the primary container of liquids, and they were stoppered with pieces of other types of wood, often with a layer of cloth in the hole to provide a better airtight seal.  By the seventeenth century, glass bottles were popularized, but wooden stoppers were imperfect, and glass stoppers were far more difficult, and consequently expensive, to produce. Contrary to the myth of monastic rediscovery, though, research has shown cork stoppers were used in the modern era at least as far back as 1600.  The notion of cork stoppers seemed to exist in England by this time: in Shakespeare’s As You Like It, Rosalind remarks to Celia, “I pray thee, take the cork out of thy mouth, that I may drink thy tidings.” Other records appear to confirm this: accounts from English cider- and wine-making texts remark on the use of cork stoppers. [Show 1678 Vinetum britannicum with quote “Great care is to be had in choosing good Corks, much good Liquor being absolutely spoiled through the only defect of the Cork.”]  

Prior to this period, however, there is a significant period in which cork bottle stoppers weren’t widely used in. Archaeological evidence shows cork stoppers in ancient Greece and Egypt, then often coated with pitch, but at some point around the medieval period, the practice of corking bottles either was lost or died out. [Cork timeline] The production of cork has been, and today remains, highly centralized geographically and industrially – the trees only flourishes in the western Mediterranean, and half of global cork production takes place in Portugal alone [Map of cork range], and more than half of the total cork trade’s value is in cork stoppers. The Portuguese Cork Association (Associação Portuguesa da Cortiça) reported in their 2019/2020 study of the cork industry that bottle stoppers dominated industry, representing 71% of exports worth €476.9 million, up 18% from 2018.

[Need to expand these two paragraphs] In a 2004 study of bottle closures, Berenice Barker proposes that the Moor conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in the eighth century disrupted cork trade, as the area has always produced most of the cork for industrial use. 
•	[Moors came from the south, along the main region of Portuguese/Spanish cork production, likely disrupting the cork growers and industrial producers living there
•	Taber argues that cork stoppers fell out of use when viticulture mostly ceased in the Iberian peninsula, and other, imperfect enclosures were used in bottles, barrels, etc.: stones, rags, and even olive oil (to sit on the surface of other liquids to prevent spoilage).


Cork has experienced repeated cycles of forgetting and rediscovery:
•	Discuss the process of rediscovering local knowledge in early modern Europe: for Schiebinger, the process of naming plants was imperialistic, preferencing European modalities of knowledge.  Perhaps this common narrative that cork stoppers were forgotten is a result of a push against the Islamic culture of the Iberian peninsula in this period: any practice that came from Moor-controlled lands were intentionally discarded.
•	[Compare to Lazarus species (taxa that are rediscovered after being thought extinct e.g. the coelacanth and Metasequoia tree).  Although some ecologists don’t like the term because the species are really just forgotten or not seen by humans, others recognize the term’s use is engaging the public. For historians, this idea is understudied in the history of ecology and broader history of knowledge. It presents the slightly different notion that forgetting and remembering are products of broader cultural]  I may cut this point


[Link JSTOR global plants specimen, cork lectotype] When Linnaeus sought to classify the cork oak tree, first in his taxonomic system for plants, published in 1753 as Species Plantarum, and then in the comprehensive 1758 Systema Naturae, he needed a specimen to typify the plant.  As he did for most of his research, Linnaeus sent one of his so-called disciples, in this case Swedish botanist Pehr Löfling [link to Wikidata page], to Spain to collect a cork tree branch. 
Löffling did not have to travel to as remote a location as some of the other disciples did for specimens, but the process of documenting Quercus suber was just as important as finding undiscovered plants to unify the disparate knowledge bases amongst botanists.


Because cork was a well-known plant, the sample is today considered a lectotype, the authoritative specimen that is selected to define an already known species’ features. The cork lectotype was only identified from the Linnaean Collection in 2013 by Iamonico and Peruzzi.  
•	Compare Dietz, who highlights the process of identifying botanical synonyms in the eighteenth century: . This can be seen in the use of Greek and Latin words for cork (Phellodrys and suber respectively), which Linnaeus ultimately synonymized by preferencing the Latin in Quercus suber. In this case, it required a specimen of a known plant. 


The many uses of cork drove scientific studies to figure out the secrets behind its useful properties, leading to a surprising role in the development of cellular biology! When Robert Hooke published his research on the minute structure of things in 1665, he cast his search widely, covering artificial objects and organic samples in his monograph Micrographia. While the images of a pin head are well known, equally important are his observations from studying the structure of cork. He remarked that the lattice walls of cork reminded him of the small cells of a monastery in which monks slept, coining the term “cell” as the fundamental unit, the building block, of life. He wrote “I no sooner descern'd these (which were indeed the first microscopical pores I ever saw, and perhaps, that were ever seen, for I had not met with any Writer or Person that had made any mention of them before this) but me thought I had with the discovery of them, presently hinted to me the true and intelligible reason of all the Phenomena of Cork.” [Link to BHL page with image].  [Robert Boyle also used them for his famous air pumps, though they were a less integral part than in Hooke’s study.]

Although the use of cork bark as medicine is less familiar to us today, many authors prescribed it as a remedy for a range of illnesses, focusing on ashes of the plant. Amongst the earliest descriptions of medical uses is that of the first-century Greek physician Dioscorides. He claimed that applying charred cork mixed with the sap of laurel to bald spots could make hair regrow thicker and darker than ever. English herbalist and botanist John Parkinson’s study of plants also focused primarily on medicinal uses, but he appears to have derived a different conclusion of cork’s applications from his ancient predecessors. He wrote in his 1640 herbal Theatrum Botanicum, “The ashes of the burnt Corke stancheth any fluxe of blood.”  (In both cases, it is unclear whether the authors are referring to ashes from just the bark of the cork tree or the wood generally.)

Burnt cork, however, holds far more sinister connotations today. American minstrel shows developed in the nineteenth century based on racist depictions of African Americans. Burnt cork, greasepaint, and even shoe polish were frequently used to create coal-black makeup white actors would use to coat their faces. As scholars like Stephen Johnson have shown, the tradition of blackface persists in American culture.  From 1888 until 2008, the University of Virginia’s yearbook was titled Corks and Curls. Although many commentators connect the title to cork makeup and wigs mimicking afros, the terms were merely student slang: “cork” for an unprepared student who remains silent “like a corked-up bottle” when called to answer a question and “curl” referring to “a student who performed well in class and who, when patted on his head by his professor, ‘curleth his tail for delight thereat.’”  Once proposed as a medicine, burnt cork is now more often invoked as a reminder of racial tensions and the frequent impulse to dismiss or even entirely forget them.

Despite these troubling associations, cork remains a ubiquitous material with great promise because of its low environmental impact. Many consumers do not realize that cork is a renewable resource — it is made from the bark of the tree, which it can subsequently regrow without harm, in some trees for over one hundred years, and cork can generally be recycled. (In fact, the tree’s natural response to regrow its bark causes it to capture more CO2.) Environmentalists frequently encourage the use of cork over other materials, for both bottle enclosures and its other diverse uses.  Cork is also commonly used for thermal insulation (the spaces between cells make it a poor heat conductor, and cork itself is naturally fire retardant), for the welts of shoes, to create airtight seals in gaskets and woodwind instruments, and as a lightweight building material for everything from architectural models, to spacecraft heat shields, to road pavement.   Today, cork is even marketed as a replacement for leather and plastics in products like purses!

[Image: cork being cultivated, Wikimedia Commons and Infographic of Cork being processed with description, including explanation of its properties: Today, we know that cork bark features a low Poisson’s ratio – it does not significantly expand or contract relative to transverse loading. This is why a cork stopper doesn’t expand up or down much when squeezed around its circumference by a wine bottle. It’s due to the large amount of free space between cork cells’ microscopic structure. This feature is also what makes cork buoyant–it isn’t very dense.]

The most common use of cork, bottle stoppers, may once again be on the way out, though the cork industry is fighting back.  Several factors are in play, revolving around axes of tradition, economics, and viticulture. Aluminum crew-tops and plastic stoppers are much cheaper, but the cork industry has mounted a defense extoling the qualities of cork. While some studies show up to 7% of bottles suffer from ‘corked’ wine, others have argued that cork can in fact improve wines.  The oft-maligned consumer demographic, millennials began drinking in a period when alternative closures were used mainly for cheaper wines, and now the cork industry worries that they are used to them. Considering that these alternative closures (especially plastic) are not biodegradable, cork seems to be the preferable material. Even if it is edged out of wine bottles, cork continues to promise new possibilities.
